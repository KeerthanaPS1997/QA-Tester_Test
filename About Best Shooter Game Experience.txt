Best Shooter Game Experience : 

Being not a hardcore gamer girl and i play shooter games very often, as i notice there are few gameplay  that made me impressive on perticular game . 

As of now i have played only 2 mobile shooter games that is “BGMI” and “COD MOBILE”.
I would like to brief about the experience between these two for now.

Both are very popular game but offers different gaming experience. In terms of diffrent game mode, graphics, weapons etc

Game play : When it comes to gameplay experience, pubg as impressed me ,because of the realistic gameplay , landscape , healing, death of player etc Whereas cod is more kind of fantasyland , futuristic weapons, unreal healing and respawn idea etc. 

And i have also experience pubg offers smooth gameplay even with low configuration mobiles. Where as cod was hanging in few low end devices.

Gun play : when we talk about gun play cod offers fantastic gunplay experience, Especially in fpp. Cod has more gun options and smooth scope transitions, recoil and wepons looks very detailed. Shoot animations is impressive. 

Whereas bgmi has less detail towards gunplay and detailing but one thing that is impressive in bgmi gun play is realistic recoil Effect.

However cod and bgmi has its own gameplay experience, which is also best of their kind. When it comes to choice between the two ultimately depends on your personal preference for gameplay mechanics, graphics, and overall style.
