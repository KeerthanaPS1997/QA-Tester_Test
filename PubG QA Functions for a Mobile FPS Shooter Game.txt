QA Functions for a Mobile FPS Shooter Game:

1. Functional Testing:

* Character movement and controls
* Weapon functionality and accuracy
* Health and damage mechanics
* Environmental interactions (ex:- door opening, vehicle usage)
* Game objectives and mission progress


2. Performance Testing:

* Frame rate and smooth gameplay
* Loading times for maps and assets
* Network latency and lag
* Device compatibility and resource usage


3. Compatibility Testing:

* Testing on various mobile devices (iOS and Android)
* Different screen resolutions and aspect ratios
* Testing on multiple operating system versions


4. Usability Testing:

* User interface (UI) design and navigation
* Player experience and feedback
* In-game tutorials and instructions


6. Regression Testing:

* Ensuring new updates or features do not break existing functionality
* Testing previously identified bugs to ensure they are fixed


7. Globalization Testing (Localization Testing):

* Translations and cultural adaptation
* Testing special characters and language-specific nuances


8. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) / Acceptance Testing:

* Collecting feedback from beta testers or a selected user group
* Assessing the game's acceptance in the target market


Why these different kinds of QA:
-------------------------------

-> Functional Testing: Ensures that all game features work as intended.

-> Performance Testing: Guarantees a smooth gaming experience across various devices.

-> Compatibility Testing: To ensure that all features are consistantly working in all the platforms.

-> Usability Testing: Enhances the player's overall experience, making the game more enjoyable and user-friendly.

-> Regression Testing: Prevents the introduction of new bugs while implementing updates.

-> Localization Testing: Ensures the game is culturally suitable and language-friendly for end users.

-> User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Gathers real user feedback to refine the game based on actual player experiences.



Cadence of QA:
--------------

-> Functional and Regression Testing : After major feature development and before releases.

-> Performance and Compatibility Testing : Before major updates and periodically across different devices.

-> Usability Testing: Before major updates and periodically to refine the user interface.

-> Localization Testing: Before international releases and when new language packs are added.

-> User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Before major releases and when significant changes are introduced based on user feedback.
